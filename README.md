### Description
This E-Commerce-Backend challenge taught me how object-relational mapping works. You can post and get json objects through insomnia. 

### Installation
fork, clone, or download this repo as a zip. Make your way to the terminal and inside the Develop directory of the project, npm install. Once the node_modules are installed, npm start.

### Usage
once the server is started, enter the route (localhost:3001) and you have the option to get, post, or delete any information in the database. Use this to your liking.
